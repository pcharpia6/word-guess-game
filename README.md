# word-guess-game

This is the third homework assignment for the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp course, due March 30, 2019.

The objective is to create a themed hangman style game with limited attempts to guess individual letters in a given word.
The chosen theme is Fantasy Warhammer.

The player is provided a visual to indicate the number of letters in the word to be guessed, as well as two hints.

The number of guesses must decrement with each incorrect guess, and all guesses will have the letter logged in a visible list.

When the player wins, the win must be logged and kept visible. A sound is played at this time. 
The number of wins must not reset unless the page is refreshed.
